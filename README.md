For Front-end Setup:

Just simply download and open the Front-end folder and type "npm install" in git bash terminal then type "npm run dev" to run the front-end task.

For Back-end Setup:

Since we were asked to not use a database the backend is also simple we just have to download it and type "npm install" in git bash terminal then type "nodemon index.js" or "node index.js" to run the backend server.

To make the various API requests I have made use of express and made a seperate controller file which contains all the methods of CRUD that will be invoked to make changes to the data. For the data I have defined a data.js file which contains a object with the dummy data values.

To test the backend Server API I used postman to test the various routes.

For get all Route I did this:
